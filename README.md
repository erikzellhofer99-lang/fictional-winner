But today... TODAY IS DIFFERENT.

I'd like to thank:

### 🚀 What's Next?

Now that I've accomplished the impossible, I'm setting my sights even higher:

- [ ] Write code that doesn't need comments to explain what it does
- [ ] Name variables properly the first time
- [ ] Commit messages that actually describe the changes
- [ ] Not breaking production on a Friday afternoon
